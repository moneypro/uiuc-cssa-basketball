# General
web: Website \w full functions and dependencies on a MySQL server. (Currently on mine.)

sql: The backup sql file with SQL template sheet to transform Excel stat spreadsheets into SQL commands.

stats: Stats for 2015 Fall.

# Todo
(MUST) Set up a new MySQL database and restore the back up. Change the name / password in php/DBConnection.php

Rebuild the front-end with AngularJS or AJAX.

UI / CSS update. (I like Jett's design, but I think we should migrate to a template really bad.)

Pictures. Agenda / Schedule page / features.

#Trivial
I don't recommend turn this project into a MEAN project, which basically means redo everything... However, it is a practice after my CS 411 class and it worked out quite well.
This should suffice a CS 411 Project in any circumstances.

I think the team sign-up page is highly optional, and I'll recommend a Google form rather than implement it yourself as I recommend Battlefy for the Esports tournament instead of us designing a new system.

At the end of the day, though it is a rough and premature project, it is on the right track. Expand it to Intramural / other basketball events is highly possible.
